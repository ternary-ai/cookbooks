      "{'Legal Proceedings': \" Item 3. Legal Proceedings \\n\\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings. \\n\\nThe Company, Wes Cummins, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and David Rench, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, have been named as defendants in a putative securities class action lawsuit in the matter styled, McConnell v. Applied Digital Corporation, et al., Case No. 3:23-cv-1805, filed in August 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the &#8220;Securities Lawsuit&#8221;). Specifically, the complaint asserts claims pursuant to Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on allegedly false or misleading statements regarding the company&#8217;s business, operations, and compliance policies, including claims that the Company overstated the profitability of its data center hosting business and its ability to successfully transition into a low-cost cloud services provider and that the Company&#8217;s board of directors was not &#8220;independent&#8221; within the meaning of NASDAQ listing rules. On May 22, 2024, the court appointed Lead plaintiff and approved lead counsel, and on July 22, 2024, Lead Plaintiff filed an amended complaint which asserts the same claims based on similar allegations in the original complaint. The Company&#8217;s response to the Complaint is due on September 20, 2024. \\n\\nOn November 15, 2023, a putative derivative action was filed in the matter styled, Weich v. Cummins, et al., Case No. A-23-881629-C in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada. The Weich complaint names as defendants certain members of the Company&#8217;s Board Wes Cummins, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and purports to name David Rench, the Company&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer, as a defendant. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and unjust enrichment based upon allegations that the defendants caused or allowed the Company to make materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company&#8217;s business, operations and compliance policies. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Company overstated the profitability of the Data Center Hosting Business and its ability to successfully transition into a low-cost cloud services provider and that the Board was not &#8220;independent&#8221; within the meaning of Nasdaq listing rules. On February 27, 2024, the derivative plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting the same claims as the original complaint. On June 5, 2024, the Court entered an order granting the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss without prejudice and dismissing all claims against all defendants, including the Company. As of the date of this filing, the plaintiff has not sought leave to file an amended complaint or filed an appeal of the order dismissing the action. \\n\\nThe Company is unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision in these actions. If an unfavorable action were to occur, it is possible that the impact could be material to the Company&#8217;s results of operations in the period(s) in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. \\n\\nThere are no other pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of the Company&#8217;s consolidated operations. \\n\\n\"}\n"
