## About Ternary Capital

Ternary Capital is committed to advancing the field of autonomous systems and financial technology through cutting-edge research and innovation. Our team comprises experts in machine learning, finance, and software engineering, striving to push the boundaries of what's possible in these domains.

## Dataset Collection

Our cookbooks collection covers a wide range of topics relevant to autonomous agents and financial applications, including:

- **Local LLM** : Running agents through a model-as-a-service provider will quickly become expensive. 
- **Tool use** : We are particularly interested in understanding tool use. 
- **Memory Management** : Memory provides grounded context for our agents reducing hallucinations and improving reliability.
- **Knowledge Graphs** : We believe Knowledge Graphs are a key pathway towards efficient reasoning helping our agents to ground their thought process.
- **Synthetic data**: Creating data that explains data in a high quality can be really helpful in training agents and improve reliablity.
- **AOT**: Whatever doesn't fit in the other categories.
